# Real-Time Emotion Detection System 🎭

A deep learning–based real-time emotion detection system that identifies human
facial emotions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The trained model is
deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Understanding human emotions from facial expressions is crucial for applications
such as surveillance, human-computer interaction, and smart policing. Manual
monitoring is inefficient and error-prone. This project automates emotion
recognition using computer vision and deep learning.
